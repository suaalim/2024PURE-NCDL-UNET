# 2024PURE-NCDL-UNET
How to run:

*All experiments are in jupyter notebook. 

*All experiments in IntroductionToNCArchitectures, LossFunctionComparison, and NonCartesianArchitectureComparison are done using the DUTS dataset. Please download the dataset and replace the path to the images and masks 
--> You can download the DUTS dataset in the following: http://saliencydetection.net/duts/

*All experiments in MedicalSegmentation are done using the dataset from Medical Segmentation Decathlon. Please download the dataset and replace the path to the images and masks.
--> You can download the MSD dataset in the following: http://medicaldecathlon.com/
--> I have specifically chosen the heart images, but you can choose any of the 3d images.

*A summary of the experiments and diagrams for all the models are in the NCDL experiment summary pdf.

1. Refer to ncdl.ai as to how to use the framework and get used to non-Cartesian computing in deep learning. All the non-Cartesian models implemented are done using the framework found in ncdl.ai
2. Go to ncdl.ai to clone the repository and install the ncdl package (the instructions are in ncdl.ai).
3. Clone/Download the directories containing the models and experiments to the repository that you cloned and installed the ncdl package.
